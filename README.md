This is an idea from the imagination of Chrystie T. Nguyen. She wanted a way to teach her kids to learn the value of money and how delayed gratification can help them have more advantages in the future. Studies have found that children who delay gratification have higher SAT scores, lower levels of substance abuse, lower likelihood of obesity, better responses to stress, better social skills, and generally better scores in a range of other life measures.


The project was created during the Women Who Code 2nd Annual Diversity Hackathon. The talents of Chrystie T. Nguyen, Kevin Conway, and Karen Kelly made this application possible and we all look forward to working on it more to make it a reality.
